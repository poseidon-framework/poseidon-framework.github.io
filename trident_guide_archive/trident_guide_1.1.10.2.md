## Guide for trident v1.1.10.2

### The trident CLI

Trident is a command line software tool structured in multiple subcommands. If you installed it properly you can call it on the command line by typing `trident`. This will show an overview of the general options and all subcommands, which are explained in detail below.

```
Usage: trident [--version] [--logMode ARG] [--errLength ARG]
               [--inPlinkPopName ARG] (COMMAND | COMMAND)
  trident is a management and analysis tool for Poseidon packages. Report issues
  here: https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidon-hs/issues

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  --version                Show version number
  --logMode ARG            How information should be reported: NoLog, SimpleLog,
                           DefaultLog, ServerLog or VerboseLog
                           (default: DefaultLog)
  --errLength ARG          After how many characters should a potential error
                           message be truncated. "Inf" for no truncation.
                           (default: CharCount 1500)
  --inPlinkPopName ARG     Where to read the population/group name from the FAM
                           file in Plink-format. Three options are possible:
                           asFamily (default) | asPhenotype | asBoth.

Package creation and manipulation commands:
  init                     Create a new Poseidon package from genotype data
  fetch                    Download data from a remote Poseidon repository
  forge                    Select packages, groups or individuals and create a
                           new Poseidon package from them
  genoconvert              Convert the genotype data in a Poseidon package to a
                           different file format

                           remote Poseidon repositories
  summarise                Get an overview over the content of one or multiple
                           Poseidon packages
  summarize                Synonym for summarise
  survey                   Survey the degree of context information completeness
                           for Poseidon packages
  validate                 Check one or multiple Poseidon packages for
                           structural correctness
```

Trident allows to work directly with genotype data (see `-p` below), but its optimized for the interaction with [Poseidon packages](https://poseidon-framework.github.io/#/standard), which wrap and contextualize the data. Most trident subcommands therefore have a central parameter, called `--baseDir` or simply `-d` to specify one or more base directories to look for packages. For example, if all Poseidon packages live inside a repository at `/path/to/poseidon/packages` you would simply say `trident <subcommand> -d /path/to/poseidon/dirs/` and `trident` would automatically search all subdirectories inside of the repository for valid Poseidon packages (as identified by valid `POSEIDON.yml` files).

You can arrange a poseidon repository in a hierarchical way. For example:

```
/path/to/poseidon/packages
    /modern
        /2019_poseidon_package1
        /2019_poseidon_package2
    /ancient
        /...
        /...
    /Reference_Genomes
        /...
        /...
```

You can use this structure to select only the level of packages you're interested in, even individual ones, and you can make use of the fact that `-d` can be given multiple times.

Being able to specify one or multiple repositories is often not enough, as you may have your own data to co-analyse with the main repository. This is easy to do, as you simply need to provide your own genotype data as yet another Poseidon package to be added to your `trident` command. For example, let's say you have genotype data in `EIGENSTRAT` format (`trident` supports `EIGENSTRAT` and `PLINK` as formats.):

```
~/my_project/my_project.geno
~/my_project/my_project.snp
~/my_project/my_project.ind
```

then you can make that to a skeleton Poseidon package with the [`init`](#init-command) command. You can also do it manually by simply adding a `POSEIDON.yml` file, with for example the following content:

```
poseidonVersion: 2.5.0
title: My_awesome_project
description: Unpublished genetic data from my awesome project
contributor:
  - name: Stephan Schiffels
    email: schiffels@institute.org
packageVersion: 0.1.0
lastModified: 2020-10-07
genotypeData:
  format: EIGENSTRAT
  genoFile: my_project.geno
  snpFile: my_project.snp
  indFile: my_project.ind
jannoFile: my_project.janno
bibFile: sources.bib
```

Two remarks: 1) all file paths are considered _relative_ to the directory in which `POSEIDON.yml` resides. Here we assume that you put this file into the same directory as the three genotype files. 2) Besides the genotype data files there are two (technically optional) files referenced by this example `POSEIDON.yml` file: `sources.bib` and `my_project.janno`. Of course you can add them manually - `init` automatically creates empty dummy versions.

Once you have set up your own "Poseidon" package (which is really only a skeleton so far), you can add it to your `trident` analysis, by simply adding your project directory to the command using `-d`, for example:

```
trident list -d /path/to/poseidon/packages/modern \
  -d /path/to/poseidon/packages/ReferenceGenomes
  -d ~/my_project --packages
```

#### General notes

##### Logging and command line output

For all subcommands the general argument `--logMode` defines how trident reports messages (to stderr) on the command line:

- *NoLog*: Hides all messages.
- *SimpleLog*: Plain and simple output to stderr.
- *DefaultLog*: Adds severity indicators before each message. (default setting)
- *ServerLog*: Additionally adds timestamps before each message.
- *VerboseLog*: Shows not just messages on the log levels `Info`, `Warning` and `Error` like the other modes, but also on the more verbose level `Debug`. Use this for debugging.

##### Duplicates

- If multiple packages in a package repository share the same `title`, then trident will try to select the one with the highest version number. If this is not sufficient to resolve the conflict, trident will stop.
- Individual/sample names (`Poseidon_ID`s) within one package have to be unique, or trident will stop.
- We generally also discourage ID duplicates across packages in package repositories, but trident will generally continue with them after printing a warning. This does not apply for `validate`, by default (you can change this behaviour with `--ignoreDuplicates`), and `forge`. `forge` offers a special mechanism to resolve duplicates within its selection language (see below).

##### Group names in .fam files

The `.fam` file of Plink-formatted genotype data is used inconsistently across different popular aDNA software tools to store group/population name information. The (global) option `--inPlinkPopName` with the arguments `asFamily` (default), `asPhenotype` and `asBoth` allows to control the reading of the population name from Plink `.fam` files. The subcommands that write genotype data (`forge`, `genoconvert`) have a corresponding option `--outPlinkPopName` to specify this for the output.

##### Whitespaces in the `.janno` file

While reading the `.janno` file `trident` trims all leading and trailing whitespaces around individual cells. Also all instances of the `No-Break Space` unicode character will be removed. This means these whitespaces will not be preserved when a package is `forge`d.

### Package creation and manipulation commands

#### Init command

`init` creates a new, valid Poseidon package from genotype data files. It adds a valid `POSEIDON.yml` file, a dummy .janno file for context information and an empty .bib file for literature references.

```
Usage: trident init ((-p|--genoOne ARG) | --inFormat ARG --genoFile ARG
                      --snpFile ARG --indFile ARG) [--snpSet ARG]
                    (-o|--outPackagePath ARG) [-n|--outPackageName ARG]
                    [--minimal]
  Create a new Poseidon package from genotype data

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  -p,--genoOne ARG         one of the input genotype data files. Expects .bed or
                           .bim or .fam for PLINK and .geno or .snp or .ind for
                           EIGENSTRAT. The other files must be in the same
                           directory and must have the same base name
  --inFormat ARG           the format of the input genotype data: EIGENSTRAT or
                           PLINK (only necessary for data input with --genoFile
                           + --snpFile + --indFile)
  --genoFile ARG           the input geno file path
  --snpFile ARG            the input snp file path
  --indFile ARG            the input ind file path
  --snpSet ARG             the snpSet of the package: 1240K, HumanOrigins or
                           Other. (only relevant for data input with
                           -p|--genoOne or --genoFile + --snpFile + --indFile,
                           because the packages in a -d|--baseDir already have
                           this information in their respective POSEIDON.yml
                           files) Default: Other
  -o,--outPackagePath ARG  the output package directory path
  -n,--outPackageName ARG  the output package name - this is optional: If no
                           name is provided, then the package name defaults to
                           the basename of the (mandatory) --outPackagePath
                           argument
  --minimal                should only a minimal output package be created?
```

</details>

The command

```
trident init \
  --inFormat EIGENSTRAT/PLINK \
  --genoFile path/to/geno_file \
  --snpFile path/to/snp_file \
  --indFile path/to/ind_file \
  --snpSet 1240K|HumanOrigins|Other \
  -o path/to/new_package_name
```

requires the format (`--inFormat`) of your input data (either `EIGENSTRAT` or `PLINK`), the paths to the respective files (`--genoFile`, `--snpFile`, `--indFile`), and optionally the "shape" of these files (`--snpSet`), so if they cover the `1240K`, the `HumanOrigins` or an `Other` SNP set. A simpler interface added in trident 0.29.0 is available with `-p (+ --snpSet)`.

|          | EIGENSTRAT | PLINK |
|----------|------------|-------|
| genoFile | .geno      | .bed  |
| snpFile  | .snp       | .bim  |
| indFile  | .ind       | .fam  |

The output package of `init` is created as a new directory `-o`, which should not already exist, and gets the package `title` corresponding to the basename of `-o`. You can also set the title explicitly with `-n`. The `--minimal` flag causes `init` to create a minimal package with a very basic `POSEIDON.yml` and no `.bib` and `.janno` files.

#### Fetch command

`fetch` allows to download Poseidon packages from a remote Poseidon server. Read more about this repository [here](repo_overview).

<details>
 <summary><i class="fas fa-search"></i> <i class="fas fa-terminal"></i> <b>Click here for command line details</b></summary>

```
Usage: trident fetch (-d|--baseDir DIR)
                     (--downloadAll |
                       (--fetchFile ARG | (-f|--fetchString ARG)))
                     [--remoteURL ARG] [-u|--upgrade]
  Download data from a remote Poseidon repository

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  -d,--baseDir DIR         a base directory to search for Poseidon Packages
                           (could be a Poseidon repository)
  --downloadAll            download all packages the server is offering
  --fetchFile ARG          A file with a list of packages. Works just as -f, but
                           multiple values can also be separated by newline, not
                           just by comma. -f and --fetchFile can be combined.
  -f,--fetchString ARG     List of packages to be downloaded from the remote
                           server. Package names should be wrapped in asterisks:
                           *package_title*. You can combine multiple values with
                           comma, so for example: "*package_1*, *package_2*,
                           *package_3*". fetchString uses the same parser as
                           forgeString, but does not allow excludes. If groups
                           or individuals are specified, then packages which
                           include these groups or individuals are included in
                           the download.
  --remoteURL ARG          URL of the remote Poseidon server
                           (default: "https://c107-224.cloud.gwdg.de")
  -u,--upgrade             overwrite outdated local package versions
```

</details>

It works with 

```
trident fetch -d ... -d ... \
  -f "*package_title_1*,*package_title_2*,*package_title_3*,group_name,<Individual1>"
```

and the entities you want to download must be listed either in a simple string of comma-separated values, which can be passed via `-f`/`--fetchString`, or in a text file (`--fetchFile`). Entities are then combined from these sources.

Entities are specified using a special syntax (see also the documentation of `forge` below): Package titles are wrapped in asterisks: *package_title*, group names are spelled as is, and individual names are wrapped in angular brackets, liks `<Individual1>`. Fetch will figure out which packages need to be downloaded to include all specified entities. `--downloadAll`, which can be given instead of `-f` and `--fetchFile`, causes fetch to download all packages from the server. The downloaded packages are added in the first (!) `-d` directory (which gets created if it doesn't exist), but downloads are only performed if the respective packages are not already present in an up-to-date version in any of the `-d` dirs.

Note that `trident fetch` makes most sense in combination with `trident list --remote`: First one can inspect what is available on the server, then one can create a custom fetch command.

`fetch` also has the optional arguments `--remote https:://..."` to name an alternative poseidon server. The default points to the [DAG server](repo_overview). 

To overwrite outdated package versions with `fetch`, the `-u`/`--upgrade` flag has to be set. Note that many file systems do not offer a way to recover overwritten files. So be careful with this switch.

#### Forge command

`forge` creates new Poseidon packages by extracting and merging packages, populations and individuals from your Poseidon repositories.

<details>

```
Usage: trident forge ((-d|--baseDir DIR) |
                       ((-p|--genoOne ARG) | --inFormat ARG --genoFile ARG
                         --snpFile ARG --indFile ARG) [--snpSet ARG])
                     [--forgeFile ARG | (-f|--forgeString ARG)]
                     [--selectSnps ARG] [--intersect] [--outFormat ARG]
                     [--minimal] [--onlyGeno] (-o|--outPackagePath ARG)
                     [-n|--outPackageName ARG] [--packagewise]
                     [--outPlinkPopName ARG]
  Select packages, groups or individuals and create a new Poseidon package from
  them

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  -d,--baseDir DIR         a base directory to search for Poseidon Packages
                           (could be a Poseidon repository)
  -p,--genoOne ARG         one of the input genotype data files. Expects .bed or
                           .bim or .fam for PLINK and .geno or .snp or .ind for
                           EIGENSTRAT. The other files must be in the same
                           directory and must have the same base name
  --inFormat ARG           the format of the input genotype data: EIGENSTRAT or
                           PLINK (only necessary for data input with --genoFile
                           + --snpFile + --indFile)
  --genoFile ARG           the input geno file path
  --snpFile ARG            the input snp file path
  --indFile ARG            the input ind file path
  --snpSet ARG             the snpSet of the package: 1240K, HumanOrigins or
                           Other. (only relevant for data input with
                           -p|--genoOne or --genoFile + --snpFile + --indFile,
                           because the packages in a -d|--baseDir already have
                           this information in their respective POSEIDON.yml
                           files) Default: Other
  --forgeFile ARG          A file with a list of packages, groups or individual
                           samples. Works just as -f, but multiple values can
                           also be separated by newline, not just by comma.
                           Empty lines are ignored and comments start with "#",
                           so everything after "#" is ignored in one line.
                           Multiple instances of -f and --forgeFile can be
                           given. They will be evaluated according to their
                           input order on the command line.
  -f,--forgeString ARG     List of packages, groups or individual samples to be
                           combined in the output package. Packages follow the
                           syntax *package_title*, populations/groups are simply
                           group_id and individuals <individual_id>. You can
                           combine multiple values with comma, so for example:
                           "*package_1*, <individual_1>, <individual_2>,
                           group_1". Duplicates are treated as one entry.
                           Negative selection is possible by prepending "-" to
                           the entity you want to exclude (e.g. "*package_1*,
                           -<individual_1>, -group_1"). forge will apply
                           excludes and includes in order. If the first entity
                           is negative, then forge will assume you want to merge
                           all individuals in the packages found in the baseDirs
                           (except the ones explicitly excluded) before the
                           exclude entities are applied. An empty forgeString
                           (and no --forgeFile) will therefore merge all
                           available individuals. If there are individuals in
                           your input packages with equal individual id, but
                           different main group or source package, they can be
                           specified with the special syntax
                           "<package:group:individual>".
  --selectSnps ARG         To extract specific SNPs during this forge operation,
                           provide a Snp file. Can be either Eigenstrat (file
                           ending must be '.snp') or Plink (file ending must be
                           '.bim'). When this option is set, the output package
                           will have exactly the SNPs listed in this file. Any
                           SNP not listed in the file will be excluded. If
                           option '--intersect' is also set, only the SNPs
                           overlapping between the SNP file and the forged
                           packages are output.
  --intersect              Whether to output the intersection of the genotype
                           files to be forged. The default (if this option is
                           not set) is to output the union of all SNPs, with
                           genotypes defined as missing in those packages which
                           do not have a SNP that is present in another package.
                           With this option set, the forged dataset will
                           typically have fewer SNPs, but less missingness.
  --outFormat ARG          the format of the output genotype data: EIGENSTRAT or
                           PLINK. Default: PLINK
  --minimal                should only a minimal output package be created?
  --onlyGeno               should only the resulting genotype data be returned?
                           This means the output will not be a Poseidon package
  -o,--outPackagePath ARG  the output package directory path
  -n,--outPackageName ARG  the output package name - this is optional: If no
                           name is provided, then the package name defaults to
                           the basename of the (mandatory) --outPackagePath
                           argument
  --packagewise            Skip the within-package selection step in forge. This
                           will result in outputting all individuals in the
                           relevant packages, and hence a superset of the
                           requested individuals/groups. It may result in better
                           performance in cases where one wants to forge entire
                           packages or almost entire packages. Details: Forge
                           conceptually performs two types of selection: First,
                           it identifies which packages in the supplied base
                           directories are relevant to the requested forge, i.e.
                           whether they are either explicitly listed using
                           *PackageName*, or because they contain selected
                           individuals or groups. Second, within each relevant
                           package, individuals which are not requested are
                           removed. This option skips only the second step, but
                           still performs the first.
  --outPlinkPopName ARG    Where to write the population/group name into the FAM
                           file in Plink-format. Three options are possible:
                           asFamily (default) | asPhenotype | asBoth. See also
                           --inPlinkPopName.
```

</details>

`forge` can be used with

```
trident forge -d ... -d ... \
  -f "*package_name*, group_id, <individual_id>" \
  -o path/to/new_package_name
```

where the entities (packages, groups/populations, individuals/samples) you want in the output package can be denoted either as a string on the command line (`-f`/`--forgeString`), or in an input text file (`--forgeFile`). See the section below for the syntax of this selection language. Do not forget to wrap the `--forgeString` query in quotes.

Including one or multiple Poseidon packages with `-d` is not the only way to include data for a forge operation. It is also possible to consider unpackaged genotype data directly with `-p (+ --snpSet)` or `--inFormat + --genoFile + --snpFile + --indFile (+ --snpSet)`. This makes the following example possible, where we merge data from one Poseidon package and two genotype datasets to get a new EIGENSTRAT dataset.

```
trident forge \
  -d 2017_GonzalesFortesCurrentBiology \
  -p 2018_VeeramahPNAS/2018_VeeramahPNAS.fam \
  --inFormat PLINK \
  --genoFile 2017_HaberAJHG/2017_HaberAJHG.bed \
  --snpFile 2017_HaberAJHG/2017_HaberAJHG.bim \
  --indFile 2017_HaberAJHG/2017_HaberAJHG.fam \
  -f "<STR241.SG>,<ERS1790729.SG>,Iberia_HG.SG" \
  -o testpackage \
  --outFormat EIGENSTRAT \
  --onlyGeno
```

##### The forge selection language

The text in `--forgeString` and `--forgeFile` are parsed as a domain specific query language that describes precisely which entities should be compiled in the output package of a given `forge` operation. The language has multiple syntactic elements and a specific evaluation logic.

In general a `--forgeString` query consists of multiple entities, separated by `,`. The main entities are Poseidon packages, groups/populations and individuals/samples:

- Each package title is surrounded by `*`: `*package*`. That means if you want all individuals of the Poseidon package `2019_Jeong_InnerEurasia` in the output package you would add `*2019_Jeong_InnerEurasia*` to the query.
- Groups/populations are not specially marked: `group`. So to get all individuals of the group `Swiss_Roman_period`, you would simply add `Swiss_Roman_period`.
- Individuals/samples are surrounded by `<` and `>`: `<individual>`. `ALA026` therefore becomes `<ALA026>`. A second way to denote individuals is with the more verbose and specific syntax `<package:group:individual>`. Such defined individuals take precedence over differently defined ones (so: directly with `<individual>` or as a subset of `*package*` or `group`). This allows to resolve duplication issues precisely -- at least in cases where the duplicated individuals differ in source package or primary group.

In the `--forgeFile` each line is treated as a separate forgeString, empty lines are ignored and `#`s start comments. So this is a valid forgeFile:

```
# Packages
*package1*, *package2*

# Groups and individuals from other packages beyond package1 and package2
group1, <individual1>, group2, <individual2>, <individual3>

# group2 has two outlier individuals that should be ignored
-<bad_individual1> # This one has very low coverage
-<bad_individual2> # This one is from a different time period
```

By prepending `-` to the bad individuals, we can exclude them from the forged package. `forge` figures out the final list of samples to include by executing all forge-entities in order. So an entity list `*PackageA*,-<Individual1>,GroupA` may result in a different outcome than `*PackageA*,GroupA,-<Individual1>`, depending on whether `<Individual1>` belongs to `GroupA` or not. If the forge entity list starts with a negative entity, or if the entity list is empty, `forge` will implicitly assume you want to include all individuals in all packages found in the baseDirs (except the ones explicitly excluded, of course).

An empty forgeString will therefore merge all available individuals.

##### Treatment of the .janno file while merging

`forge` merges and subsets .janno files along with the genotype data. If a package lacks a .janno file, then a basic one will be created internally based on the information in the genotype data, and used for the output. Missing columns across packages will be filled with `n/a`. 

For merging two .janno files **A** and **B** the following rules apply regarding undefined, arbitrary additional columns:

- If **A** has an additional column which is not in **B** then empty cells in the rows imported from **B** are filled with `n/a`.
- If **A** and **B** share additional columns with identical column name, then they are treated as semantically identical units and merged accordingly.
- In the resulting .janno file, all additional columns from both **A** and **B** are sorted alphabetically and appended after the normal, specified variables.

The following example illustrates the described behaviour:

**A.janno**

| Poseidon_ID | Group_Name | Genetic_Sex | AdditionalColumn1 | AdditionalColumn2 |
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| XXX011      | POP1       | M           | A                 | D                 |
| XXX012      | POP2       | F           | B                 | E                 |
| XXX013      | POP1       | M           | C                 | F                 |

**B.janno**

| Poseidon_ID | Group_Name | Genetic_Sex | AdditionalColumn3 | AdditionalColumn2 |
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| YYY022      | POP5       | F           | G                 | J                 |
| YYY023      | POP5       | F           | H                 | K                 |
| YYY024      | POP5       | M           | I                 | L                 |

**A.janno + B.janno**

| Poseidon_ID | Group_Name | Genetic_Sex | AdditionalColumn1 | AdditionalColumn2 | AdditionalColumn3 |
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| XXX011      | POP1       | M           | A                 | D                 | n/a               |
| XXX012      | POP2       | F           | B                 | E                 | n/a               |
| XXX013      | POP1       | M           | C                 | F                 | n/a               |

| YYY023      | POP5       | F           | n/a               | K                 | H                 |
| YYY024      | POP5       | M           | n/a               | L                 | I                 |

##### Other options

Just as for `init` the output package of `forge` is created as a new directory `-o`. The title can also be explicitly defined with `-n`.
  
`--minimal` allows for the creation of a minimal output package without `.bib` and `.janno`. This is especially useful for data analysis pipelines, where only the genotype data is required. Even more basic output comes with `--onlyGeno`, which means that only the genotype data is returned without any Poseidon package.

`forge` has a an optional flag `--intersect`, that defines, if the genotype data from different packages should be merged with an **union** or an **intersect** operation. The default (if this option is not set) is to output the union of all SNPs, with genotypes defined as missing in samples from packages which do not have a SNP that is present in another package. With this option set, on the other hand, the forged dataset will typically have fewer SNPs, but less missingness.

`--intersect` also influences the automatic determination of the `snpSet` field in the POSEIDON.yml file for the resulting package. If the `snpSet`s of all input packages are identical, then the resulting package will just inherit this configuration. Otherwise `forge` applies the following pairwise merging logic:

| Input snpSet A | Input snpSet B | `--intersect` | Ouput snpSet |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Other          | *              | *             | Other        |
| 1240K          | HumanOrigins   | True          | HumanOrigins |
| 1240K          | HumanOrigins   | False         | 1240K        |

`--selectSnps` allows to provide `forge` with a SNP file in EIGENSTRAT (`.snp`) or PLINK (`.bim`) format to create a package with a specific selection. When this option is set, the output package will have exactly the SNPs listed in this file. Any SNP not listed in the file will be excluded. If `--intersect` is also set, only the SNPs overlapping between the SNP file and the forged packages are output.

Merging genotype data across different data sources and file formats is tricky. `forge` is more verbose about potential issues, if the `--logMode` flag is set to `VerboseLog`.

The `--onlyGeno` command specifies that only genotype data should be output, not an entire Poseidon package. 

With `--packagewise` the within-package selection step in forge can be skipped. This will result in outputting all individuals in the relevant packages, and hence a superset of the requested individuals/groups. It may result in better performance in cases where one wants to forge entire packages.

#### Genoconvert command

`genoconvert` converts the genotype data in a Poseidon package to a different file format. The respective entries in the POSEIDON.yml file are changed accordingly.

                           EIGENSTRAT. The other files must be in the same
                           directory and must have the same base name
  --inFormat ARG           the format of the input genotype data: EIGENSTRAT or
                           PLINK (only necessary for data input with --genoFile
                           + --snpFile + --indFile)

                           the directories where the input genotype data file
                           (.bed/.geno) is stored

  --outPlinkPopName ARG    Where to write the population/group name into the FAM
                           file in Plink-format. Three options are possible:
                           asFamily (default) | asPhenotype | asBoth. See also
                           --inPlinkPopName.
```

</details>

With the default setting

```
trident genoconvert -d ... -d ... --outFormat EIGENSTRAT|PLINK
```

all packages in `-d` will be converted to the desired `--outFormat` (either `EIGENSTRAT` or `PLINK`), if the data is not already in this format. This includes updating the respective POSEIDON.yml files.

The "old" data is not deleted, but kept around. That means conversion can result in a package with both PLINK and EIGENSTRAT data, but only one is linked in the POSEIDON.yml file, and that is what will be used by trident. To delete the old data in the conversion you can add the `--removeOld` flag.

Instead of `-d` to change Poseidon packages, the `-p (+ --snpSet)` or `--inFormat + --genoFile + --snpFile + --indFile (+ --snpSet)` allow to directly convert genotype data that is not wrapped in a Poseidon package and store it to a directory given in `-o`. See this example:

```
trident genoconvert \
  -p 2018_Mittnik_Baltic/Mittnik_Baltic.bed \
  --outFormat EIGENSTRAT
  -o my_directory
```

#### Update command

`update` automatically harmonizes POSEIDON.yml files of one or multiple packages if the packages were changed. This is not an automatic update from one Poseidon version to the next!

<details>
 <summary><i class="fas fa-search"></i> <i class="fas fa-terminal"></i> <b>Click here for command line details</b></summary>

```
Usage: trident update (-d|--baseDir DIR) [--poseidonVersion ARG]
                      [--ignorePoseidonVersion] [--versionComponent ARG]
                      [--noChecksumUpdate] [--newContributors ARG]
                      [--logText ARG] [--force]
  Update POSEIDON.yml files automatically

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  -d,--baseDir DIR         a base directory to search for Poseidon Packages
                           (could be a Poseidon repository)
  --poseidonVersion ARG    Poseidon version the packages should be updated to:
                           e.g. "2.5.3" (default: Nothing)
  --ignorePoseidonVersion  Read packages even if their poseidonVersion is not
                           compatible with the trident version. The assumption
                           is, that the package is already structurally adjusted
                           to the trident version and only the version number is
                           lagging behind.
  --versionComponent ARG   Part of the package version number in the
                           POSEIDON.yml file that should be updated: Major,
                           Minor or Patch (see https://semver.org)
                           (default: Patch)
  --noChecksumUpdate       Should update of checksums in the POSEIDON.yml file
                           be skipped
  --ignoreGeno             ignore SNP and GenoFile
  --newContributors ARG    Contributors to add to the POSEIDON.yml file in the
                           form "[Firstname Lastname](Email address);..."
  --logText ARG            Log text for this version jump in the CHANGELOG file
                           (default: "not specified")
  --force                  Normally the POSEIDON.yml files are only changed if
                           the poseidonVersion is adjusted or any of the
                           checksums change. With --force a package version
                           update can be triggered even if this is not the case.
```

</details>

It can be called with a lot of optional arguments

```
trident update -d ... -d ... \
  --poseidonVersion "X.X.X" \
  --versionComponent Major/Minor/Patch \
  --noChecksumUpdate
  --ignoreGeno
  --newContributors "[Firstname Lastname](Email address);..."
  --logText "short description of the update"
  --force
```

By default `update` will not edit a package's POSEIDON.yml file, even when arguments like `--versionComponent`, `--newContributors` or `--logText` are explicitly set. This default exists to run the function on a large set of packages where only few of them were edited and need an active update. A package will only be modified by `update` if either

- any of the files with checksums (e.g. the genotype data) in it were modified,
- the `--poseidonVersion` argument differs from the `poseidonVersion` in the package's POSEIDON.yml file
- or the `--force` flag was set in `update`.

If any of these applies to a package in the search directory (`--baseDir`/`-d`), it will be updated. This includes the following steps:

- If `--poseidonVersion` is different from the `poseidonVersion` field in the package, then that will be updated.
- The `packageVersion` will be incremented. If `--versionComponent` is not set, then it falls back to `Patch`, so a change in the last position of the three digit version number. `Minor` increments the middle, and `Major` the first position (see [semantic versioning](https://semver.org)).
- The `lastModified` field will be updated to the current day (based on your computer's system time).
- The contributors in `--newContributors` will be added to the `contributor` field if they're not there already.
- If any checksums changed, then they will be updated. If certain checksums are not set yet, then they will be added. The checksum update can be skipped with `--noChecksumUpdate` or partially skipped for the genotype data with `--ignoreGeno`.
- The CHANGELOG.md file will be updated with a new row for the new version and the text in `--logText` (default: "not specified"), which will be appended as the first line of the file. If no CHANGELOG.md file exists, then it will be created and referenced in the POSEIDON.yml file.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: As `update` reads and rewrites POSEIDON.yml files, it may change their inner order, layout or even content (e.g. if they have fields which are not in the [Poseidon package definition](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidon-schema)). Create a backup of the POSEIDON.yml file before running `update` if you are uncertain.

```
trident list -d ... -d ... --packages
```

This will yield a table like this

```
so a nicely formatted table of all packages, their last update and the number of individuals in it.

To view packages on the remote server, instead of using directories to specify the locations of repositories on your system, you can use `--remote` to show packages on the remote server. For example

```
trident list --packages --remote
```

will result in a view of all published packages in our [public online repository](repo_overview).

You can also list groups, as defined in the third column of EIGENSTRAT `.ind` files (or the first column of a PLINK `.fam` file), and individuals with `--groups` and `--individuals` instead of `--packages`.

The `--individuals` flag provides a way to immediately access information from the `.janno` files on the command line. This works with the `-j`/`--jannoColumn` option. For example adding `--jannoColum Country --jannoColumn Date_C14_Uncal_BP` to the commands above will add the `Country` and the `Date_C14_Uncal_BP` columns to the respective output tables.

Note that if you want a less fancy table, for example because you want to load this into Excel, or pipe into another command that cannot deal with the neat table layout, you can use the `--raw` option to output that table as a simple tab-delimited stream.

#### Summarise command

`summarise` prints some general summary statistics for a given poseidon dataset taken from the .janno files.

<details>
 <summary><i class="fas fa-search"></i> <i class="fas fa-terminal"></i> <b>Click here for command line details</b></summary>

```
Usage: trident summarise (-d|--baseDir DIR) [--raw]
  Get an overview over the content of one or multiple Poseidon packages

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  -d,--baseDir DIR         a base directory to search for Poseidon Packages
                           (could be a Poseidon repository)
  --raw                    output table as tsv without header. Useful for piping
                           into grep or awk
```

</details>

You can run it with

```
trident summarise -d ... -d ...
```

which will show you context information like -- among others -- the number of individuals in the dataset, their sex distribution, the mean age of the samples (for ancient data) or the mean coverage on the 1240K SNP array in a table. `summarise` depends on complete .janno files and will silently ignore missing information for some statistics.

You can use the `--raw` option to output the summary table in a simple, tab-delimited layout.

#### Survey command

`survey` tries to indicate package completeness (mostly focused on `.janno` files) for poseidon datasets.

<details>
 <summary><i class="fas fa-search"></i> <i class="fas fa-terminal"></i> <b>Click here for command line details</b></summary>

```
Usage: trident survey (-d|--baseDir DIR) [--raw]
  Survey the degree of context information completeness for Poseidon packages

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  -d,--baseDir DIR         a base directory to search for Poseidon Packages
                           (could be a Poseidon repository)
  --raw                    output table as tsv without header. Useful for piping
                           into grep or awk
```

</details>

Running

```
trident survey -d ... -d ...
```

will yield a table with one row for each package. See `trident survey -h` for a legend which cell of this table means what.

Again you can use the `--raw` option to output the survey table in a tab-delimited format.

#### Validate command

`validate` checks poseidon datasets for structural correctness. 

<details>
 <summary><i class="fas fa-search"></i> <i class="fas fa-terminal"></i> <b>Click here for command line details</b></summary>

```
Usage: trident validate (-d|--baseDir DIR)
  Check one or multiple Poseidon packages for structural correctness

Available options:
  -h,--help                Show this help text
  -d,--baseDir DIR         a base directory to search for Poseidon Packages
                           (could be a Poseidon repository)
  --ignoreGeno             ignore SNP and GenoFile
  --fullGeno               test parsing of all SNPs (by default only the first
                           100 SNPs are probed)
  --noExitCode             do not produce an explicit exit code
  --ignoreDuplicates       do not stop on duplicated individual names in the
                           package collection
```

</details>

You can run it with

```
trident validate -d ... -d ...
```

and it will either report a success (`Validation passed`) or failure with specific error messages to simplify fixing the issues. 

`validate` tries to ensure that each package in the dataset adheres to the [schema definition](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidon-schema). Here is a list of what is checked:

- Presence of the necessary files
- Full structural correctness of .bib and .janno file
- Superficial correctness of genotype data files by parsing the first 100 SNPs. A full check that parses all SNPs can be run with the `--fullGeno` option
- Correspondence of BibTeX keys in .bib and .janno
- Correspondence of individual and group IDs in .janno and genotype data files

In fact much of this validation already runs as part of the general package reading pipeline invoked for many trident subcommands (e.g. `forge`). `validate` is meant to be more thorough, though, and will explicitly fail if even a single package is broken.

Remember to run it with `--logMode VerboseLog` to get more information if the output is not sufficient to debug an issue.
