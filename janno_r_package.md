# janno R package <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

janno (formerly known as poseidonR) is an R package to simplify the interaction with .janno files in Poseidon packages. It provides a dedicated R S3 class `janno` that inherits from `tibble` and allows to tidily read and manipulate the context information stored in them. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/janno/).

You can install the janno package from GitHub with the following command in R:

```
if(!require('remotes')) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('poseidon-framework/janno')
```

The guide below explains the main functions in the package. It is available in .pdf format here:

## Guide for the janno R package v1.0.0

### Installation

See the Poseidon website (<www.poseidon-adna.org/#/janno_r_package>) or the GitHub repository (<www.github.com/poseidon-framework/janno>) for up-to-date installation instructions.

### Read janno files

You can read `.janno` files with

```
my_janno_object <- janno::read_janno(
  path = "path/to/my/janno_file.janno",
  to_janno = TRUE,
  validate = TRUE
)
```

The path argument takes one or multiple file paths or directory paths. `read_janno()` searches recursively for `.janno` files in the directory paths.

Before loading the `.janno` files they are validated with `janno::validate_janno()`. You can avoid this potentially time consuming step with `validate = FALSE`.

Usually the `.janno` files are loaded as normal `.tsv` files with every column type set to `character` and then the columns are transformed to the intended types. This transformation can be turned off with `to_janno = FALSE`.

`read_janno()` returns an object of class `janno`. `janno` objects are derived [`tibble`s](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), which integrate well with the tidyverse ([@Wickham2019](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01686)) and its packages, e.g. `dplyr` or `ggplot2`. As long as the data layout does not change, they will remain `janno` objects and not be transformed to default tibbles.

### Validate janno files

You can validate `.janno` files with

```
my_janno_issues <- janno::validate_janno("path/to/my/janno_file.janno")
```

`validate_janno` returns a tibble with issues in the respective `.janno` files.

### Write janno objects back to .janno files

`janno` objects usually contain list columns, that can not directly be written to a flat text file like the `.janno` file. The function `write_janno` solves that. It employs a helper function `flatten_janno`, which translates list columns to the string list format in `.janno` files (so: multiple values for one cell separated by `;`). This only works for vector list columns, so when each cell contains a vector of values. If a list column cotains other data structures, e.g. `data.frame`s, they will be dropped and replaced with the NULL value `n/a` in the resulting `.janno` file.

```
janno::write_janno(
  my_janno_object,
  path = "path/to/my/new/janno_file.janno"
)
```

### Process age information in janno objects

`.janno` files contain age information in multiple different columns. See the .janno file documentation for a detailed explanation of these variables. The function `janno::process_age()` works with this age information to calculate different derived columns, which are then added to the input `janno` object.

You can run it with

```
janno::process_age(
  my_janno_object,
  choices = c("Date_BC_AD_Prob", "Date_BC_AD_Median_Derived", "Date_BC_AD_Sample"),
  n = 100,
  cal_curve = "intcal20"
)
```

`janno::process_age` includes calibration of radiocarbon dates with the Bchron R package ([@Haslett2008](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9876.2008.00623.x)). The calibration curve set in `cal_curve` is applied for every date in the `janno` object. If there are multiple radiocarbon dates for one sample they are automatically combined as the normalized sum of all individual post-calibration probability distributions. 

The `choices` argument contains the list of columns that should be calculated and added by `janno::process_age`. `n` is the number of samples that should be drawn for `Date_BC_AD_Sample`.

#### Output column `Date_BC_AD_Prob`

`Date_BC_AD_Prob` is a list column with a data.frame for each `janno` row, so each sample. This data.frame stores a density distribution (`sum_dens`) over a set of years BC/AD (`age`) with the information of a given year is within two standard deviations (`two_sigma`) from the median age (`center`). 

| age   | sum_dens   | two_sigma | center |
|-------|------------|-----------|--------|
| -1506 | 0.00000456 | FALSE     | FALSE  |
| -1505 | 0.00000622 | FALSE     | FALSE  |
| -1504 | 0.00000907 | FALSE     | FALSE  |
| ...   | ...        | ...       | ...    |

The density distributions are either the result of (sum) calibration on radiocarbon dates or -- for samples that are only contextually dated -- a uniform distribution over the archaeologically determined age.

#### Output column `Date_BC_AD_Median_Derived`

`Date_BC_AD_Median_Derived` is a simple integer column with the median age (in years BC/AD) as determined from `Date_BC_AD_Prob`.

#### Output column `Date_BC_AD_Sample`

`Date_BC_AD_Sample` is again a list column with a vector of `n` ages (in years BC/AD) for each sample. These ages are randomly drawn with `base::sample(prob = ...)` considering the probability distribution calculated for `Date_BC_AD_Prob`.

### General helper functions

When you are preparing a `.janno` file and want to determine the entries for the columns `Date_BC_AD_Median`, `Date_BC_AD_Start` and `Date_BC_AD_Stop` from radiocarbon dates, then `janno::quickcalibrate()` might come in handy.

```
janno::quickcalibrate(ages, sds)
```

`ages` takes a list of uncalibrated C14 ages BP and `sds` a list of the respective standard deviations. If multiple ages are provided for one sample, then the function automatically performs a sum calibration. 

`quickcalibrate(list(1000, c(2000, 2200)), list(20, c(30, 40)))` for example returns a data.frame like this: 

| Date_BC_AD_Start_2Sigma| ... | Date_BC_AD_Median| ... | Date_BC_AD_Stop_2Sigma|
|-----------------------:|----:|-----------------:|----:|----------------------:|
|                     994| ... |              1029| ... |                   1149|
|                    -383| ... |               -88| ... |                    117|

This output can be copied to the new `.janno` file, where `Date_BC_AD_Start_2Sigma` corresponds to `Date_BC_AD_Start`, and `Date_BC_AD_Stop_2Sigma` to `Date_BC_AD_Stop`.
