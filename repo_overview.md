# The Public Poseidon Repositories

We, so the [Department of Archaeogenetics](https://www.eva.mpg.de/archaeogenetics/index.html) at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and many affiliated colleagues around the world, maintain public repositories that serves as a central hub for most data we use, produce and publish.

While we're planning a more interactive web interface to explore the available data, at this point you can reach it i) through [this](https://poseidon-framework.github.io/published_data/) very simple page, ii) through our [Web-API](#the-dag-poseidon-webserver), or iii) through the [`trident`](trident#fetch-command) command line software.

## Our git repositories

We opted to monitor our repositories with [Git](https://git-scm.com) to ensure clean version management on the file level. The context data in a Poseidon package is text data that can be stored and maintained easily with line-wise version control. Unfortunately that does not hold true for the large genotype data files. They are not suitable to be handled in Git directly. Instead we rely on Github's [large file storage system](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github), which works, but comes with a number of technical hurdles and drawbacks both for us and the user.

We generally do _not_ recommend to use the github repositories for end-user-level access to our packages, so to download the data. We do recommend that you work through Github, though, if you would like to submit an issue or suggest changes to the data (e.g. via a Pull Request).

## The DAG-Poseidon Webserver

We have a webserver running, which currently has several APIs implemented (see [server](server)), including

1. `/packages`: Using [https://c107-224.cloud.gwdg.de/packages](https://c107-224.cloud.gwdg.de/packages), one receives a JSON-list of packages available at the server. Each JSON entry has a title, a description, a last-modified date and a package version.
2. Under `<package_name>/zip_file`, one can download a package as a zip-file, for example [https://c107-224.cloud.gwdg.de/zip_file/2020_Yu_NorthRussia](https://c107-224.cloud.gwdg.de/zip_file/2020_Yu_NorthRussia).

The webserver is powered by an HTTP server program called `poseidon-http-server` (see also [server](server)), whose source-code can be reviewed at the [same repository](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidon-hs) as `trident` is sourced. For those interested to run their own instance of this webserver, for example under `localhost`, the server comes with a short command line help. It gets installed via `stack install`, similarly to `trident`. The program first scans the given directories for Poseidon packages, then creates zip-files for them, and then starts a HTTP server listening - by default - to port 3000, and providing the two APIs listed above.
